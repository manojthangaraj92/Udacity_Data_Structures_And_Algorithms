## Course: Data Structures and Algorithms
## Project 2: Show Me the Data Structures
## Problem 6: Union and Intersection

### Explanation of time and space complexity analysis
### Explanation
The solution is achieved with the class Node and Class LinkedList.
The node will have information about its value and next node

The LinkedList will have the methods for appending or popping the node
and information such as its size.

### Time complexity
The methods Union and Intersection has the time complexity O(n) as it should traverse through
each element in the linked list to check the union, intersection of its elements

### Space complexity
Space complexity is O(n) for the both Union and Intersection method as it should keep all the elements in
memory.
