## Problem 2: File Recursion

### Explanation of time and space complexity analysis
### Explanation
File recursion problem is achieved with the use of recursion 

### Time complexity
Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of files and diretories in
the given path

### Space complexity
Space complexity is O(n) where n is number of files in directories.
