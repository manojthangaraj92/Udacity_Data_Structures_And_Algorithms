## Problems Vs. Algoritms
## Problem 1: Finding the Square root of the integer.

---
### Solution

- This problem is solved using the recursive binary search approach where the base cases are 
  - When the square of the mid value is equal to the number or start index reaches greater than the end index, return the number
- A different function having the start and end index of the number and do a binary search in the recursive way.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this problem is O(log(n)) as this was the recursive binary search

### Space 

The Space complexity is O(1) as algorithm takes no extra space.
