## Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

---
### Solution

The task is to traverse only one time through the list and find the maximum and minimum
elements in the unsorted list. The expected time of complexity is O(n)

This is achieved by having two variables for minimum and maximum.
Minimum being the first element of the list and maximum being zero and traverse through the 
list and compare with each element and upadte them at the end 

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this problem is O(n) as it traverses through the list

### Space 

The Space complexity is O(1) as algorithm takes no extra space.
