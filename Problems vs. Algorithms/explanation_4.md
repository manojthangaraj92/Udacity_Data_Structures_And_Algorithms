### Solution

The solution can be found if 0s and 1s can be pushed to start and end respectively and 1s
at the middle.

Two variables for zeros and twos and loop through the list, push zero to the start and 2s
to the end. This is an in place sorting Algorithm 

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this problem is O(n) as it traverses through the list

### Space 

The Space complexity is O(1) as algorithm takes no extra space.
